# webgl_experiements

A testing of using straight webgl after failed attempts of using other libraries

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- to start: run `npm install`, then `node server.js`
- changes: you will need to restart the service each time edits are made

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# considerations

After trying to use a multiude of different libraries, using webgl was the only way to actually access any of the funtionality I wanted. At 5/28/21, this project is solely the teacup that was introduced on a demo website where I took code and started playing; this same week I am trying to work with rendering a cube map behind the scene.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# future plans

Continue playing around with different components of the service. Likely try building my own shaders using the underlying funtionality of the current program.
